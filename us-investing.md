# US ETFs and Index Funds

So you want to invest in the US markets then you would notice there are several indices involved in the US markets similar to the Indian counterparts Sensex and Nifty. As with India most of the ETFs and mutual funds you will find in the market will be either tracking these indices (Index funds or ETFs) or be benchmarked to them. I will try to be as objective as possible here though excuse if it feels opinionated in some parts. 

## Meeting the Indices

As with India there's several indices in the US though we will focus on some of the big ones.

### Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
This is the OG index that measures the stock performance of 30 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. The direct comparison to this index is the Indian S&P BSE Sensex 30 index though there are some key differences to the dow and all other indices. This difference is very important and the reason why most people in finance consider this a poor measure of the market. The Dow Jones is not a free float index. What's is a free float methodology? Courtesy: Investopedia, it's defined as 

>  The free-float methodology is a method of calculating the market capitalization of a stock market index's underlying companies. With the free-float methodology, market capitalization is calculated by taking the equity's price and multiplying it by the number of shares readily available in the market. 

Instead of using the free float, the Dow Jones takes 30 stocks, adds the prices of each share in the 30 and divides them by a fixed value (that value as of 1st February is set to 0.152).

Dow Jones operates across the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.

### S&P500 

This is the big one. The S&P500 tracks the 505 common stocks (yes, 505 because someone companies like Google have multiple share classes both included) issued by 500 large cap companies across the US market. Unlike the Dow this index is built by using the free float market capitalization methodology and could be considered the flagship index for the US markets. 

The S&P500 is a strongly diversified index compared to NASDAQ due to the NASDAQ having lower barriers to entry as compared to the NYSE which encourages startups and other newly minted corporates to first list on the NASDAQ over the NYSE. Since this index unlike the NASDAQ index tracks the NYSE aswell it also covers several mature companies. 

The S&P500  operates across the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ and the Chicago Board Options Exchange.

### NASDAQ Composite Index

As briefly touched in the last index, the NASDAQ exchange has severely lower barriers to entry. Normally, exchange will have tests and if a company can satify all requirements under a single test they qualify to list. Furthermore, even post listing the company must satisfy market cap requirements. In the case of the NYSE companies must maintain a minimum market cap of $15 million over a 30 day trading period versus the NASDAQ requirement of 750,000 public shares outstanding worth at least $1.1 million. 

What this means is that many of the smaller startups and growth based ventures flock to the NASDAQ to the listing and as of this post, most of them are tech companies. Investing in the NASDAQ can be considered a proxy for investing in high growth companies or even a bet on the tech sector.

### CRSP US Total Market Index

This one is a fairly unknown index but it should not be underestimated. It tracks nearly 4,000 constituents across mega, large, small and microcaps and covers nearly 100% of the investible companies in US. It is the benchmark index for Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares (VTSAX), the world's largest fund by AUM standing at $1.08 Trillion as of this post.
